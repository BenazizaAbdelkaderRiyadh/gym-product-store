## üöÄ Getting Started

This is a static frontend project and does not require a complex build process.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a simple local web server to run this project and avoid potential CORS issues when serving files locally. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is recommended, as it gives you access to `npx`.

### Running Locally

1.  Clone this repository or download the project files.
2.  Create an `/assets` folder in the root of the project and download the necessary media files. You will need to save the product images from the links and download the YouTube video as an MP4.
    *   **`assets/1.png`**
    *   **`assets/2.png`**
    *   **`assets/3.png`**
    *   **`assets/video.mp4`**
3.  Open your terminal in the project's root directory.
4.  Run a simple web server. For example, using the `serve` package:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
5.  Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided by the server.
